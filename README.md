Emotion Classification in ISEAR Dataset

The ISEAR dataset was imported and preprocessed through steps like lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming. Feature engineering involved sequence encoding, padding, label encoding, and integrating GloVe embeddings for semantic understanding. Emotion classification was performed using both a deep learning-based BiLSTM model and a baseline Logistic Regression model for comparison.
